## Lead Instructor: Chase

Hi, my name is Chase, I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student at UCLA.

Super excited to teach this class, I actually never got the opportunity to take a CS class until I got college so I'm super happy that you guys are getting some early exposure to some super interesting and relevant technologies that I use almost every day.

First and foremost I'm here to support you, so if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesistate to reach out. [chasekap@gmail.com](mailto:chasekap@gmail.com)

## Teach LA President: Matt

Hey there, my name is Matt! I'm a 3rd-year Computer Science & Math-Economics double major at UCLA, and I'm particularly passionate about how we can use computers to empower people!

This class has been something that I've been working on for the past year, and I'm super super excited to bring this to all of you! The technologies that underpin this class - HTML, CSS, JS, React, React Native, GitHub - are things that I've worked with for years as a software developer and a student, and I want to share these with you.

I've done web development (and other CS things) at startups, medium-sized companies, and huge ones (Amazon!) - if you have any questions about web development, computer science, or really anything, I'd be glad to talk about it! Say hi in the class, or shoot me an email at [matt@matthewwang.me](mailto:matt@matthewwang.me)!
